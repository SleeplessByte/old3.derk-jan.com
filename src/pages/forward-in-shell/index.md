title: Forward arguments in shell

For one of my CLIs, I needed to remove the first argument from the argument list
and forward the rest to a next process. In this example, my shell script is
called `cli_process` and given arguments `arg1`, `arg2` and `arg3`, I want to
execute `forward_process` with `arg2` and `arg3`.

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

# Why quoting the argument is "necessary":

# eats 1 argument
shift 1

# forwards the rest to "forward_process"
forward_process "$@"
```

## Windows

Windows `.bat` files support a similar token: `%*`, which is equivalent to `$@`.
However, the `SHIFT` command, unlike the bash equivalent `shift`, doesn't modify
this special token. There are various solutions that will attempt to eat the
first `n` parameters, but all of them have edge-cases in which they don't
properly work. Should you need this in windows, I recommend you write out the
arguments manually `%2`, `%3` (and skip `%1`).

Here you can find some Windows solutions, but make sure you check the comments
underneath each one:
